# SpaceApps_2019

J.W.S.T. AR ASSEMBLER

We created an AR videogame where the player interact with cards and organize them so the whole 3D model can be generated.
The application shows the James Webb Space Telescope divided on pieces in each card. The player needs to scan the cards with the smartphone and in order to see the whole 3D model, the cards need to be in the correct order.

To see the information of each telescope part the player needs to pass the hand over it.


We used Unity 3D and Vuforia to build the app.

We recommend to use unity 2019.2.9f1


There are some bugs with the cards when colliding, working on that.
